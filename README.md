What can `ViaSwiftUtils` do for you? Here are some examples we compiled:


Tired of spelling out `NSLocalizedString` every time you localize a string?
```swift
title = "HomePage.title".localized
print(title) // 'Main', '頭版', 'صفحه نخست', 'Startseite'
```

--------

Want to find the longest word in a string?
```swift
print(germanText.longestWord())
// 'Verkehrsinfrastrukturfinanzierungsgesellschaft'
```

--------

Need an array (or any other `MutableCollection`) shuffled? [^3]
```swift
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers.shuffleInPlace() //e.g. [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3]
```

--------

Want all the unique entries in a `Sequence` with `Hashable` elements?
```swift
let emojis = ["😀", "👀", "😱", "😡", "👀", "😀", "👀", "😱"]
let uniqueEmojis = emojis.unique() // ["😀", "👀", "😱", "😡"]
```

--------

Is dealing with `TimeInterval` inconvenient?
```swift
let twelveDays = 12 * TimeInterval.day
let minutes = twelveDays / TimeInterval.minute // 17280
```

--------

Need to create an image with rounded corners from an existing image?

--------

Does one of the views in your app need to rotate?
```swift
someView.startRotating()
// ...
someView.stopRotating()
```

--------

And more date helper methods & variables:
```swift
let components = DateComponents(calendar: gregorian, era: 0,
                                year: 44, month: 3, day: 15, hour: 13)
let idesOfMarch = gregorian.date(from: components)!
let weekDay = idesOfMarch.dayOfWeek // 6
let daysSince = idesOfMarch.days(to: Date()) // 752533
```

These are just a few examples. We are expanding the library continuously and we accept Pull-Requests ☺️

## How to install [ViaSwiftUtils](https://github.com/ViacomInc/ViaSwiftUtils)

#### Via Cocoapods
Add the following line to your `Podfile`.
Remember you'll need to enable `use_frameworks!`.
```
pod 'ViaSwiftUtils', '2.1.0'
```


#### Via Carthage
Add the following line to your `Cartfile`
```
github "ViacomInc/ViaSwiftUtils" == 2.1.0
```

#### Via Swift package manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` 
```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/ViacomInc/ViaSwiftUtils.git", .exact("2.1.0")),
]

.target(name: <#yourTarget#>, dependencies: ["ViaSwiftUtils"]),
```
I should mention that only the `Foundation` functions that are part of `ViaSwiftUtils` work via SPM, as `UIKit` is not available on Linux or MacOS.


#### Importing
After you installed the framework via one of the 3 above methods, import it in your `.swift` file.
```swift
import ViaSwiftUtils
```
